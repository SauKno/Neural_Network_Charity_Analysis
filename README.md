# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
In this challenge a nonprofit foundation, Alphabet Soup, is looking for an analysis that will predict which organizations are worth donating to based on their risk. This deep learning neural network evalutes all types of input data and producxes a clear decision making result using the TensorFlow Library. As a part of the challenge we were to explore at least three different neural networks to try and get the accuracy of the model to 75% or more. 

##Results
**Data Preprocessing**
*What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?*
IS_SUCCESSFUL column

*What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?*
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, & ASK_AMT columns

*What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?*
EIN, NAME, STATUS, & SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
*How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?*
*Were you able to achieve the target model performance?*
*What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?*
